Row States and Row Versions

Every DataRow contained in a DataTable of a DataSet has a RowState property.
The following provides a detailed description of RowStates and RowVersions.

Row States:
RejectChanges and AcceptChanges Methods for datarows:
According to Microsoft, there are five RowState values, 
Unchanged - No changes have been made since the last call to AcceptChanges or since the row was created by DataAdapter.Fill().
Added - The row has been added to the table, but AcceptChanges has not been called.
Modified - An element of the row has been changed
Deleted - The row had been deleted from the table and AcceptChanges has not been called.
Detached - the row is not part of a DataRowCollection. The RowState of a newly created row is set to Detached.
   After the DataRow is added to the DataRowCollection by calling the Add method, the value of the RowState property is set to Added.
   Detached is also set for a row that has been removed from a DataRowCollection using the Remove method or by the Delete method followed by the AcceptChange method.
When AcceptChanges method is called on a DataSet,DataTable or DataRow, all rows with a row state of Deleted are removed.
The remaining rows are given a row state of Unchanged, and the values in the Original row version are overwritten with the Current row version values.
When RejectChanges is called, all rows with a row state of Added are removed. The remaining rows are given a row state Unchanged, and the values in the Current row version are overwritten with the Original row version values.
 
Row Versions:
Current - The current values for the row. This row version does not exist for rows with a RowState of Deleted. This is the default version.
Default-The default row version for a particular row. The default row version for an Added, Modified, or Unchanged row is Current. The default row version for a Deleted row is Original. The default row version for a Detached row is Proposed.
Original - The original values for the row. This row version does not exist for rows with a RowState of Added.
Proposed - The proposed values for the row. This row version exists during an edit operation on a row, or for a row that is not part of a DataRowCollection.

The HasVersion() method can be used to check if a row has a specific DataRowVersion. This returns a boolean.
Example: DataRow.HadVersion(DataRowVersion.Original);

When the AcceptChanges() method is invoked the RowState property of each DataRow changes. The Added/Modified rows are now Unchanged and Deleted rows are removed.
When the RejectChanges() method is invoked, the RowState property of each DataRow changes. The system is rolled back to the original state and the transaction is reversed.
Added rows are removed. Modified and Deleted rows are rolled back to the original state and are now Unchanged.

The AcceptChanges() and RejectChanges() methods can be invoked at the DataSet level, the DataTable level and in addition can be invoked on a specific DataRow.
